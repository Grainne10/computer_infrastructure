# Getting started

1. The first step is to create the repository in Github. I then cloned this repository in my own directory in my personal files.
It is important to regularly push this to my own files.
In the repository I also created a git.ignore files for items I do not want to send to the repository e.g. temp files, sample test files and code.
I created a read me document to document my steps and project.

2. Task 1 : '

Using codes spaces, I created a new directory structure called data using mkdir. Then I created two sub-directories called timestamps and weather again using mkdir.

3. Task 2 :Timestamps
In the codespace, I ran the command date, this printed the current date and time . Using double angled brackets, I changed the output direction to a new file "now.txt" creating the file at the same time. date >> now.txt. Then, on the command line, I ran this ten times. By using the double angled brackets , it appends the file and shows the output at each stage the command is run. If I were to use a single angled bracket , >, this would over-write the file each time the command is run. The result of the running this command ten times can be seen in the now.txt file and shows a list of dates and time, in this case the same date and hour but different minutes and seconds.
