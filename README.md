# Getting started

1. The first step is to create the repository in Github. I then cloned this repository in my own directory in my personal files.
It is important to regularly push this to my own files.
In the repository I also created a git.ignore files for items I do not want to send to the repository e.g. temp files, sample test files and code.
I created a read me document to document my steps and project.

2. Using codes spaces, I created a new directory structure called data using mkdir. Then I created two sub-directories called timestamps and weather again using mkdir
